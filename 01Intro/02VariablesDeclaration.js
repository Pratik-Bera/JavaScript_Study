var a1 = 45   //"It was use in early. but that is nor recomanded now. There fore we need to use let kw"
console.log(a1)

//recomanded way
let a2 = "This is recomanded way."
console.log(a2)

// we also use const but there has a different purpose
const a3 = "This is const"    // we need assign it now and we can't change the value of it.
console.log(a3)

//a3="How is your day?"     // that is gives an Error. beacause a3 is const.

//Use Cases :
let str = "I love to travel."
console.log(str)
console.log(typeof (str))
str = 45                      // Js gives the permission to change the datatypes of variable.so you can store another data types is same variable.
console.log(str)
console.log(typeof (str))
