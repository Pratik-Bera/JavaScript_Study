    ** and print it to console when ever he gives number between 0 to 10 to 4 steps.
    ** after each step value range will be increased to next 10 values means after step 1 range will be 10 to 20
    ** If user gives number outside 0 and 10 then all just print the warning and terminate all remaining steps.
